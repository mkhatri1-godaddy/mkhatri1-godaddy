## 👀 Why are you stalking me?

So… you’ve scrolled all the way here. Curious, aren’t you? 😏

🐛 Bugs? Fixed. Deployed. Logged.  
🔧 Code? Runs smooth. Looks cleaner than my weekend plans.  
🧐 Weird flex: I review my own PRs… and leave comments like “Who wrote this genius?”  
🛠️ Stack Overflow? Only for helping others now 😌  
⚙️ Incidents? Never met her.
⭐ Since you're here... star something before I start linting your profile.

It was all the flex — I’m just a developer trying to keep `main` green. 😇
