## 👀 Why are you stalking me?

Oh hey... didn't expect company. What brings you here?

🕵️‍♂️ **Looking for bugs?**  
→ Already fixed, deployed, and celebrated with coffee. You're late. 🐛🚫☕

🙌 **Here to praise my code?**  
→ Aww, stop it... actually, don’t. Keep going. 😌✨

🔓 **Trying to uncover my dev secrets?**  
→ Spoiler: It's 90% caffeine, 10% Googling, and 110% deleting `console.log()` before committing. 🔍🧃⌨️

👓 **Reviewing my code?**  
→ Bold move. I already reviewed it myself and left a `LGTM 🚀` on my own PR. Twice. 😎🫡

⭐ **Since you're lurking this hard...**  
→ At least leave a star. It’s like a digital handshake. Or a high-five. Or a hug. Your call.

That’s all the flex — I'm just a chill dev trying to keep `main` green, the logs clean, and the bugs scared. 😇💻
